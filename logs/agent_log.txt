Several factors can contribute to the development of cancer, often involving a combination of:

*   **Genetic mutations:** These can be inherited from parents or acquired during a person's lifetime due to errors in cell division or damage to DNA.
*   **Lifestyle choices:** Such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, an unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, and obesity.
*   **Environmental exposures:** Including ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, ionizing radiation (like X-rays), and exposure to certain chemicals (carcinogens) like asbestos or air pollution.
*   **Infections:** Some viruses (e.g., HPV, Hepatitis B and C) and bacteria (e.g., *H. pylori*) can increase cancer risk.
